I am trying to make a real-world application of a very simple Login UI in C++ that is text based. Here's how it will go:
Stage 1:
1) Let user sign up in which credentials get saved locally. 
(First name, Last name, DOB, Email, Password)
2) Let user sign in using saved credentials.
(Email, Password) *Must match saved credentials*

Stage 2:
1) Implement password strength detection.
(Password must meet some criteria)

Stage 3:
1) Email address verification.
(Figure out a way to send an email to the user's email to acquire some type of confirmation)
2) Phone number verification.
(Figure out a way to send a text message to the user's phone to acquire some type of confirmation)
3) Random *strong* password generator when sign up.
(Instead of making the user create their own password, generate a random password by default for which the user can change it later and send to email.)
*Stage 3 might not be possible on the short-term*
